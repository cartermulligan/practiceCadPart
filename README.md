Practice cad part deisgned off of a google image search on autodesk fusion cad drawings. The photo I used as reference will be submitted along with the files/screenshots.

design my cad part, just the cad drawing in the thumbnail. (https://www.youtube.com/@3Diest) <-- youtube channel of the video thumbnail I used
